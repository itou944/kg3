Redux Organization and State Management

1. File Structure:
   /src
     /redux
       store.js
       keyGunSlice.js
     /constants
       constants.js

2. Redux Setup:

   a. store.js:
      - This file configures the Redux store using configureStore from @reduxjs/toolkit.
      - It combines all reducers (currently only keyGunReducer).

   b. keyGunSlice.js:
      - This file defines the slice for managing KeyGun state.
      - It uses createSlice from @reduxjs/toolkit to define the reducer and actions.

3. State Structure:

   The main state structure is:

   {
     keyGuns: {
       selectedKeyGuns: []
     }
   }

   - selectedKeyGuns: An array of selected KeyGun objects, each containing:
     {
       id: number,
       name: string,
       icon: string
     }

4. Actions:

   toggleKeyGun:
   - Payload: A KeyGun object
   - Effect: Adds the KeyGun to selectedKeyGuns if not present, removes it if present.
     Ensures no more than 4 KeyGuns are selected at a time.

5. Selectors:

   While not explicitly defined, you can select the state in components using:
   const selectedKeyGuns = useSelector(state => state.keyGuns.selectedKeyGuns);

6. Constants:

   selectableKeyGuns:
   - Defined in src/constants/constants.js
   - An array of all available KeyGuns, each with id, name, and icon properties.

7. Usage in Components:

   - Components dispatch actions using:
     dispatch(toggleKeyGun(keyGun))

   - Components access state using:
     const selectedKeyGuns = useSelector(state => state.keyGuns.selectedKeyGuns);

8. State Viewer:

   A StateViewer component is available to display the entire Redux state,
   useful for debugging and development.

9. Future Considerations:

   - As the application grows, consider adding more slices for different features.
   - Implement memoized selectors using createSelector for performance optimization.
   - Add middleware for side effects (e.g., redux-thunk or redux-saga) if needed.

Remember to keep this documentation updated as you add more features and state management to your project.
